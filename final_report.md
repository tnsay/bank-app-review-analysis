## 4. Recommendations

Based on the above analysis:

### üõ† Feature Improvements
- **BOA**: Implement user-requested features mentioned in reviews (e.g., fingerprint login, bill payments).
- **Dashen**: Enhance performance & responsiveness, as lag was a frequent concern.
- **CBE**: Improve transaction reliability to reduce user complaints.

### üå± Suggested Additions
- Introduce **budgeting tools**, **dark mode**, and better **push notifications**.
- Add a **report issue button** in the app to collect feedback in-app.

## 5. Ethical Considerations

- **Bias in Reviews**: Online reviews may over-represent dissatisfaction.
- **Language Detection Limitations**: Amharic reviews may be under-analyzed.
- **Automated Model Limits**: Sentiment analysis may miss subtle emotion or sarcasm.

## 6. Conclusion

This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for the 3 Ethiopian banks to enhance user satisfaction and prioritize future app updates. The pipeline is modular and reproducible for future updates or expansions.
